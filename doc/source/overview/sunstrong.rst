SunStrong Management and you
============================

- **Apr 15, 2025**: SunStrong transitioned the the small number of customers using cellular connections to WiFi connectivity.  It was told to customers via email.
- **Apr 21, 2025**: First apperance of the "SunStrong Connect" application in the Android Play Store as v1.0.97. The app featured a new OTA (over-the-air) upgrade feature, which lets installers — and in some cases even end-customers — remotely push firmware updates (e.g. for PVS6 inverters, Hub+, AC modules) directly from their smartphone, without having to physically connect to each device on-site.
- **Apr 22, 2025**: The iOS mySunPower app was rebranded to SunStrong Connect, as v1.0.98.  The Android app was released with this same build number on this date.
- **May 2025**: Field reports (e.g., installers on Home-Assistant forums) noted PVS6 units receiving firmware 2025.04 (build 61829), which addressed the flash‐wear “memory exhaustion” bug (a very good thing) and enabled smoother connectivity via the SunStrong Connect app.
- **mid-Jun 2025**: PVS6 firmware 2025.06 (build 61839) was released.  This is the current firmware as of Jul 2025.


.. important::

   One to note here is that the OTA feature seems to be now what
   causes firmware to be updated.  If you want to control when firmware is
   updated, try turning off Bluetooth and Background App Refresh (these are iOS
   settings, not sure about Android).  This is just a guess on my part.
   Remember to turn them back on if you need to update firmware or re-configure
   the system (because maybe you got a new WiFi router or something).

Hardware-wise, the second critical part here is that SunStrong Management has
said if you're a cash or loan customer not serviced by SunStrong, they recommend
contacting qualified solar professionals in your area for system maintenance or
repairs.  You can find a directory of licensed solar service providers in your
region by visiting our solar service provider directory.  SunStrong Management
does not support your system.  I was informed of this by a SunStrong email dated
Apr 15, 2025.

The good news here is many of the manufacturers of the various components of the
system have said that they will continue to honor their warranties.  See `What
